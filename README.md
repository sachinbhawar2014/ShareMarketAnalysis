Project Structure

    styles.css: Contains all the CSS styles for the project.
    chart.js: The Chart.js library file.
    script.js: Contains the JavaScript code to fetch data from the APIs and display it using Chart.js.
    index.html: The main HTML file that includes the necessary scripts and styles, and serves as the entry point for the project.

API Endpoints

The project fetches data from the following endpoints:

    https://stocks3.onrender.com/api/stocks/getstocksdata
    https://stocks3.onrender.com/api/stocks/getstocksprofiledata
    https://stocks3.onrender.com/api/stocks/getstockstatsdata

These endpoints are used to retrieve stock data, stock profiles, and stock statistics, which are then displayed in various charts.

Displaying Data
The fetched data is processed and displayed using Chart.js. Each type of data (stocks, profiles, stats) is visualized in a separate chart, providing a comprehensive overview of the stock information.

Conclusion

This project showcases how to effectively use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js to fetch and visualize data from external APIs. It's a practical example of how modern web technologies can be combined to create interactive and informative web applications.
